//TODO update the line below for your team and project.
# MVC Team Challenge Repository

//TODO add your team member names below.
### Team Members:

### Repository Notes
1. This repository is structured like your projects repository for class, with one main difference:
    * The project name/web application name is: teamMVC
    * After cloning the repository to your local, rename the directory to teamMVC.
2. To build and run your web application, you can simply use the command: ant
3. The MVC demo is included here to test your environment. To run, simply deploy the application using "ant". Then access the application at http://localhost/java112/mvc-demo


### When working in a team environment, it is very important to follow this workflow:
1. Before you do any work: git pull
2. Do a little work
3. Add any changes: git add .
4. Commit those changes: git commit -am "message here"
3. Merge in any changes from other team members: git pull
4. Examine the pull output for any conflicts. If there are [conflicts, resolve them](handlingConflicts.md).
5. If there are no conflicts: git push.
